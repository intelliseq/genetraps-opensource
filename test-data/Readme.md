Files *314.1.fq.gz, 314.2.fq.gz, 315.1.fq.gz, 315.2.fq.gz* were created following _description-of-creating-fq-file.md_ from anakin /home/iseq/seq/bam38/314.markdup.realigned.recalibrated.bam /home/iseq/seq/bam38/315.markdup.realigned.recalibrated.bam files.

**gvcf**

Files *300_chrUn_KI270515v1.g.vcf* and *301_chrUn_KI270515v1.g.vcf* were taken from _Centrum Badań DNA_ samples. They only cover so-called chromosome UnKI270515v1. Were used to test app *iseq_gatk_joint_genotyping*.

**vcf**

File *300_301_chrUn_KI270515v1_merged_genotyped.vcf.gz* was created by *iseq_gatk_joint_genotyping* using gvcf files mentioned above.
File *CBD_random-chr22.vcf.gz* is a merged vcf containing reads of chr22_*_random from all five _Centrum Badań DNA_ samples (194, 300, 301, 461, 483).
